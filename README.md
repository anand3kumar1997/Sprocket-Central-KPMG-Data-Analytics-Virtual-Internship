# Sprocket-Central-KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship

Recommended Potential Customers for the business to target using Data Analysis for the client aiming to expand their Profits &amp; Business. This process involved conducting a Data Quality Assessment, Building a Data Model, and Visualizing the results of the analysis.

This report has been developed as part of the KPMG AU Data Analytics virtual internship.
Here we use a data set from an imaginary company called Sprocket Central which sells bikes and my role was to find the business insights from the data given and how the addition of new customers will impact the business. 

## Task 1: Data Quality Analysis 

During my involvement with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, I acquired valuable experience in working with real-world datasets. I developed proficiency in data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure the quality of the data. I thoroughly analyzed the provided datasets, which encompassed Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data. Whenever I encountered missing or incomplete data, I promptly communicated with the client to request any additional information that was necessary.

## Task 2: Customer Targeting Recommendation

In this task, I leveraged the existing datasets as labeled datasets to formulate recommendations on which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted in order to maximize value for the organization. I devised a comprehensive approach and outlined it in a PowerPoint presentation, detailing a three-week scope that included phases such as Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. By delving into the data, I identified valuable patterns, trends, and insights that greatly informed the customer targeting recommendations.

## Task 3: Data Visualization through Dashboard

As part of developing the dashboard, I gained a thorough understanding of constructing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to effectively measure goal achievement. I familiarized myself with the process of identifying and defining KPIs that align with the client's specific objectives and goals. Through a meticulous selection process, I determined relevant metrics and measurements to monitor the performance and success of the client's business. These identified KPIs were then seamlessly integrated into the dashboard, enabling clear visualization of performance indicators that facilitated assessing the effectiveness of strategies and initiatives.
