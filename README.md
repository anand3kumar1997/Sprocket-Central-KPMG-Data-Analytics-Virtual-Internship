# Sprocket-Central-KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship

This report has been developed as part of the KPMG AU Data Analytics virtual internship.
Here we have used a data set from an imaginary company called Sprocket Central which sells bikes and recommended Potential Customers for the business to target using Data Analysis for the client aiming to expand their Profits & Business. 
This process involved conducting a Data Quality Assessment, Building a Data Model, and Visualizing the results of the analysis.


## Task 1: Data Quality Analysis 

In this task, I thoroughly analyzed the provided datasets, which included Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data. Missing or incomplete data along with any anomalies were communicated with the client and request any additional information that was necessary.


## Task 2: Customer Targeting Recommendation

In this task, I leveraged the existing datasets as labeled datasets to formulate recommendations on which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted in order to maximize value for the organization. I developed a comprehensive approach and outlined it in a PowerPoint presentation that included Analytics phases such as Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. By carefully exploring the data, I uncovered significant patterns, trends, and insights that played a pivotal role in formulating customer targeting recommendations.


## Task 3: Data Visualization through Dashboard

As part of developing the dashboard, I gained a thorough understanding of constructing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to effectively measure goal achievement. Through a defined selection process, I determined relevant metrics and measurements to monitor the performance and success of the client's business. These identified KPIs were then seamlessly integrated into the dashboard. 
Created a dashboard in Power BI to show the outcomes of our data analysis and summary.

### Tools used â€“ Advanced Excel, Python, and Power BI
